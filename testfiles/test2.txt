Due to the coronavirus pandemic most institutions have gone virtual and every student’s learning is online.
 My experience has been no different although I started attending online classes only very recently. 
 My first few online sessions were the orientation sessions before admissions conducted by IIIT h and b on zoom. 
 Thankfully my sister had already been using zoom for her classes since May and thus she could help me navigate it effectively.
  One aspect I found quite surprising was the punctuality exhibited by both institutions when starting the sessions.
I was very impressed with both sessions but I decided to join IIITb in the end.
Coming to my experience with online learning at IIITb. The Induction process was our first interaction with some of the faculty and the seniors.
 The sessions were quite informative and to the point without wasting our time. Here we had  virtual tours of the campus, learnt of the different
  facilities and resources available like Yourdost.com, quiklrn, academia and so on. The seniors also held an informal induction process in
   parallel .Here they introduced us to the various clubs like the Music club, Dance club, Debsoc, Zense, Enigma , etc. and committees like the 
   internet committee, Chayachitra , 8 bit(our magazine) and so on. We were also informed of the democratically elected student body SAC, which
    takes care of organizing most of the events held at iiitb. I was particularly intrigued with Zense and Enigma , the software development club 
    and the robotics club respectively. Most of these clubs mentioned above held workshops or seminars to help us understand them better and also
     provide us with some basic know-how in their field of work.
Since I am part of a large institution I am privy to information I might otherwise not have known. For example the professors with their multitude
 of contacts inform us of various seminars and workshops held by world renown corporations and institutes like IISc ,IBM ,Google ,etc. I recently
  attended a wonderful hour long seminar on cybersecurity and hacking conducted by IBM. This is something I would never have come across on my own .
  I am glad that these companies continue to conduct such webinars virtually even if it is a bit more complicated this way.
Last but not least , the actual academics. So far we have had only 2 days of classes. We have had programming with C, Maths ,Economics
 and Digital Design classes up until now. They have not been the greatest new  experience I have had but under the circumstances I think it
  was well done. Some of the problems were that the teacher’s audio would suddenly stop, or they would disconnect due to internet problems and 
  some students would not even switch off their audio which was quite irritating and disturbing. I liked our Economics class very much as the
   professor taught using examples from current times and thus kept us engaged.
In conclusion I would have much rather preferred us actually coming to the campus than doing everything virtually but this too is an experience
 which might not occur once again.
